# Loan-Repayment-Assessment-in-Banking

### Overview

This repository contains code for building and training a machine learning model to assess whether a customer will repay or default on a loan. The model is trained on a dataset containing various features related to loan applicants, such as employment details, credit history, and financial attributes.

### Contents

1. loan_repayment_assessment.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
2. train_loan_data.csv: CSV file containing the training dataset.
3. test_loan_data.csv: CSV file containing the test dataset.
4. predicted_test_loan_data.csv: CSV file containing the predicted loan status labels for the test dataset.


### Description

The project consists of several steps, including:

1. Importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset.
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and contents of the data.
3. Preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
4. Feature engineering to create new features and prepare the data for modeling.
5. Balancing class distribution using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
6. Feature selection to identify the most important features for predicting loan status.
7. Training machine learning models, including Gradient Boosting Classifier.
8. Evaluating model performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
9. Hyperparameter tuning using grid search to optimize model performance.
10. Making predictions on unseen data and saving the results to a CSV file.

### Usage

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Install the required libraries listed in the requirements.txt file.
2. Download the train_loan_data.csv and test_loan_data.csv files and place them in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.
3. Open the loan_repayment_assessment.ipynb notebook and execute each cell sequentially.

### Results

The trained model achieves satisfactory performance in predicting loan repayment status on unseen data. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess model performance.


## Instructions for Usage

## Setup

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/loan-repayment-assessment.git

## Navigate to the project directory:

cd loan-repayment-assessment

## Install the required libraries using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Data Preparation

1. Ensure you have the train_loan_data.csv and test_loan_data.csv files containing the training and test datasets, respectively.
2. Place these files in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook (loan_repayment_assessment.ipynb).

## Execution

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook loan_repayment_assessment.ipynb:

jupyter notebook loan_repayment_assessment.ipynb

2. Execute each cell sequentially to perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Interpretation of Results

1. Review the output and visualizations generated by each code cell to understand the data analysis and modeling process.
2. Pay attention to evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.

## Making Predictions

1. Once the model is trained and evaluated, predictions on new data can be made.
2. If you have new data for prediction, ensure it is formatted similarly to the training and test datasets.
3. Use the trained model to predict loan repayment status on the new data.
4. Save the predictions to a CSV file for further analysis or reporting.

## Customization

1. Modify the code as needed to adapt to specific use cases or datasets.
2. Experiment with different machine learning algorithms, hyperparameters, and preprocessing techniques to improve model performance.

## Feedback and Contributions

1. Provide feedback or report issues by opening an issue on the repository.
2. Contributions such as bug fixes, feature enhancements, or documentation improvements are welcome via pull requests.
